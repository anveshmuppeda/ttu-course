\noindent 
 Submit your solution in PDF file (and Latex source  file if you use Latex) to blackboard by 
 {\bf \duedate}. 
% Homework will be still accepted until 11:59am Nov 5 without penalty. 

\begin{enumerate}
% \item Acknowledge you submit ONLY ONE file and it is in PDF format. 

\item State the soundness and completeness results about 
resolution, $T$-resolution, $\mathcal{A}$-resolution, SLD-resolution. 
(Make sure what ``formula" your result is talking about.)


\item Let $S = \set{\set{A, \neg B, C}, \set{B, C}, \set{\neg A, C}, \set{B, \neg
C}, \set{\neg B}}.$ What is $S^{B}$? What is $S^{\neg B}$?  

\item Follow our proof methods, prove the following. 
% You can discuss with other people on the proof, but don't COPY other's writing. 
%By constructing the proof yourself, you'll learn the most. 

{\em If $P$ is a PROLOG program and $G = \{\neg q_1, \ldots, \neg q_n\}$ a goal clause, then every $q_i$ ($i \in 1..n$) is a consequence 
of $P$ if and only if $P \cup \{G\}$ is unsatisfiable.}

You may use the following definition of consequence in your proof: 
a literal $l$ is a {\em consequence of a formula} $S$ if for every 
assignment $\mathcal{A}$ that satisfies $S$,  $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies $l$, i.e., $l \in \mathcal{A}$. 

%{\em A formula $S$ is satisfiable if and only if either $S^l$ or $S^{\bar{l}}$ is satisfiable.} 

% \item Using the result above, prove: 

% {\em $S$ is unsatisfiable iff both $S^l$ and $S^{\bar{l}}$ are.}

\item Consider a PROLOG program $P$ and a conjunction of propositional letters $p_1, ..., p_n$. To prove that
$p_1, ..., p_n$ is a consequence of $P$, what is the set of clauses that the resolution refutations (discussed in class) are based on?  Explain why these  methods works. 

\item Consider a PROLOG program $P$: 

$\set{\pg{p :- s, t. ~~~ p :- q. ~~~ q. ~~~ q :- r. ~~~ r. ~~~ r :- w. ~~~ r. ~~~s. ~~~ t :- w.}}$

1) Draw an SLD-tree for goal $\pg{\neg p}$ in terms of $P$. 

2) What is an SLD resolution refutation of $P \cup \set{\set{\pg{\neg
p}}}$? 
\end{enumerate}
